--  Last chance handler. Unhandled exceptions are passed to this routine

--  This procedure is called when an exception is raised through compiler
--  inserted calls. It is designed to be overridden by user defined functions
--  (using the external name ``__gnat_last_chance_handler``).
--
--  The runtime provides a default last chance handler implementation, which
--  prints the exception message to the console and stops the execution.
