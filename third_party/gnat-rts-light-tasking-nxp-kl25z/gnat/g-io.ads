--  This is the zfp version of GNAT.IO package.

--  A simple text I/O package for simple I/O functions in user programs as
--  required. This package is also preelaborated, unlike ``Ada.Text_IO``, and
--  can thus be with'ed by preelaborated library units.

--  Data_Error is not raised by these subprograms for bad data. If such checks
--  are needed then the regular Text_IO package must be used.

package GNAT.IO
with
  SPARK_Mode,
  Abstract_State => (File_System),
  Initializes    => (File_System)
is
   pragma Preelaborate;

   procedure Put (X : Integer)
   with
     Global => (In_Out => File_System);
   --  Output integer to specified file, or to current output file, same
   --  output as if Ada.Text_IO.Integer_IO had been instantiated for Integer.

   procedure Put (C : Character)
   with
     Global => (In_Out => File_System);
   --  Output character to specified file, or to current output file

   procedure Put (S : String)
   with
     Global => (In_Out => File_System);
   --  Output string to specified file, or to current output file

   procedure Put_Line (S : String)
   with
     Global => (In_Out => File_System);
   --  Output string followed by new line to specified file, or to
   --  current output file.

   procedure New_Line (Spacing : Positive := 1)
   with
     Global => (In_Out => File_System);
   --  Output new line character to specified file, or to current output file

end GNAT.IO;
